    "The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus\n",
    "---\n",
    "Calculus is truly important to data science, as we are performing calculus every time we do optimization. Having a firm grasp of calculus as you head into 6003 is even more important. The fundamental theorem encompasses two elements: differentiation and integration:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\int_{a}^{b}\\dfrac{dG}{dt}dt = G(b)-G(a)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This basic concept suggests that we know that the integral is essentially the opposite of the derivative. Furthermore, it also tells us that the integral of the derivative over an interval is exactly **the difference in values of the function at the interval boundary points.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Four Fundamental Theorems of Vector Calculus\n",
    "Similarly, the four fundamental theorems of vector calculus state that an integral of some type of vector derivative over some object within a given field is equal to the **sum of values of the function along the boundary of that object.**\n",
    "\n",
    "These four theorems are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The gradient theorem of line integrals (most important)\n",
    "2. Green's theorem\n",
    "3. Stokes' theorem\n",
    "4. Gauss' theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "We will quickly cover each of these closer to the end of class.\n",

    "# A Tour De Force of Basic Calculus\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two essential tools that we need to have so we can arrive at vector calculus: The **derivative taken by limit** and the **Riemann intgral.** The story of the Riemann integral is one of the most compelling in mathematical history. Derivatives and integrals were known and studied (and used!) for *hundreds of years* before anyone came up with accurate definitions of them.\n",

    "This is all very nice, but there are many (if not most) functions that are highly valuable whose slope is not always constant. Therefore the **slope is dependent on the value of the independent variable** and hence the **slope itself is also a function of the independent variable.** \n",

    "If $f(x)$ gets closer and closer to a number $l$ as $x$ gets closer and closer to $c$ from both sides, then $l$ is the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $c$. This behavior is expressed symbolically as:\n",
