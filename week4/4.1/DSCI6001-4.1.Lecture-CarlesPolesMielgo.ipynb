    "\n",
    "The dot product has already been introduced to you as the inner product. A simplistic explanation of the dot product is to describe it as the product of the two *\"shadows\"* each vector casts on to the other. The dot product of a vector with itself is simply the square of its magnitude (as the angle between a vector and itself is 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![dot-product](./images/dot_product_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a famous old drawing that you can find in many places. The point of it is to show you that the dot product falls out of measurements of the difference between the two vectors $a$ and $b$. In particular if the angle between $a$ and $b$ is 90 degrees, then we have the only situation where the dot product is zero. Therefore, the dot product can be used to test whether or not two vectors are perpendicular or **orthogonal** to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Orthogonal is just another word for perpendicular.\n",
    "\n",
    "The proof goes as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the pythagorean theorem and the drawing to figure out a definition for the magnitude of $a-b$.\n",

    "##The Projection\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual quantity of the shadow one vector casts on another is called the *projection* of vector $a$ *onto* $b$. This is one of the most important operations you will ever learn in vector calculus. \n",
    "\n",
    "![vector-projection](./images/vector_projection.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Referring to the above figure, when $\\theta < 0$ we compute the *shadow* that *a casts on b divided by the magnitude of b*, meaning that we are canceling out the contribution of $b$ to the dot product.  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\|\\vec{a}\\| \\cos{\\theta} = \\dfrac{(\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b})}{\\| \\vec{b} \\|}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This *shadow* falls only in the direction of $\\vec{b}$. Hence we use the unit vector of $\\vec{b}$ to show the direction that the shadow is in. The unit vector of $\\vec{b}$ is written:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dfrac{\\vec{b}}{\\| \\vec{b} \\|}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the quantity we are looking for is the product of the length of the shadow in the direction of the unit vector that it falls on:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dfrac{\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}}{\\|\\vec{b}\\|}\\dfrac{\\vec{b}}{\\|\\vec{b}\\|}=\\dfrac{\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}}{\\|\\vec{b}\\|^{2}}\\vec{b}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\theta > 90$, the process is a little different (referring to the right side of the above figure). The projection falls against the backward-facing side of $\\vec{b}$ and thus its shadow is calculated: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\|\\vec{a}\\| \\cos{\\theta-\\pi} = -\\dfrac{(\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b})}{\\| \\vec{b} \\|}$$\n",

    "And we calculate it against the backward-facing direction of $\\vec{b}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$-\\dfrac{\\vec{b}}{\\| \\vec{b} \\|}$$\n",

    "However the two negative signs end up cancelling out, resulting in the same net formula:\n",
