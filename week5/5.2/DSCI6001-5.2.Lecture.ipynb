    "\n",
    "##A summary of the basic lessons of Chapter 2 in logical order\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###Properties of the matrix as a transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "####Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are a mapping from a given *domain* to an output in a given *range*. Functions can be *linear* or *nonlinear*.\n",
    "\n",
    "####Linear Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear transformations are mappings between *domain* ${\\bf V}$ and *range* ${\\bf W}$ written:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T: {\\bf V} \\xrightarrow{T} {\\bf W}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "such that the following hold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $f({\\bf v}_1 + {\\bf v}_2) = f({\\bf v}_1) + f({\\bf v}_2)$\n",
    "2. $f(c_1 {\\bf v}_1) = c_1 f({\\bf v}_1)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore $f(c_1 {\\bf v}_1 + c_2 {\\bf v}_2) = c_1 f({\\bf v}_1) + c_2 f({\\bf v}_2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear transformations can be written as a matrix. (commonly referred to as \"$A$\" The matrix will be of dimension $m \\times n$, and provides a mapping from $R^n$ to $R^m$ (make sure you understand this point).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###The different spaces of the system $A\\vec{x}$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of solutions of the transformation $T$ characterized by the $m \\times n$ matrix $A$ that we really care about:\n",
    "\n",
    "The row space:\n",
    "\n",
    "$rref(A) = row(A)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The image:\n",
    "\n",
    "$im(A) = col(A)$\n",
    "\n",
    "(The basis of linearly independent columns)\n",
    "\n",
    "The kernel:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ker(A) = \\vec{v} \\in R^n$ such that $A\\vec{v} = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "The eigenspace:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vec{x} \\in R^n$ such that $A\\vec{x} = \\lambda x$\n",
