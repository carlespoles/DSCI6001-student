    "## QR Factorization\n",
    "\n",
    "So far you have already learned the $LU$ decomposition/factorization, which was by far the most common method of obtaining a solution to a linear system for some time, until the *Francis method* of $QR$ decomposition came about in the 60's. The Francis method $QR$ decomposition not only gives the eigenvectors to a matrix, but the eigenvalues and the solution to the system as well. $LU$ is still the most common method for decomposing small matrices as it's somewhat faster, but less stable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Shortly after this, methods involving *Givens rotations* and *Householder reflections* came about (better stability). The latter method is the best for larger matrices. For very large matrices only approximate methods are possible even today due to the high order ( $O(N^{3})$ ) of all of these algorithms. "

    "It is a **theorem** that *any nonsingular (invertible) matrix can be factored into a product of two matrices*: A matrix $Q$ of orthogonal vectors (representing an image-preserving map), and an upper-right triangular matrix $R$ much like the $U$ matrix of the $LU$ factorization. From this we may obtain a unique solution to the system.\n",

    "#### Factoring noninvertible matrices (?!?!) \n",
    "\n",
    "So far all your effort (and for the rest of this class) has been bent on factoring invertible or nonsingular matrices. It may seem perhaps that there are at least as many examples of noninvertible or singular matrices that might need to be factored. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, matrix factorization proceeds by a **least-squares** algorithm. This will be covered somewhat later. Least-squares methods are what are used in industry to provide matrix factorizations at scale.\n"
