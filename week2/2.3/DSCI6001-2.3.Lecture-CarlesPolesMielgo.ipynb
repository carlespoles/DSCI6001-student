    "## Vector and Matrix Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "It's best to think of vectors and matrices as being directly related. One way of thinking about it is considering a vector to be essentially a single-row matrix. Column vectors can be then compared to columns of a matrix and row vectors can be compared to rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additive Rules of Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "For three matrices $\\textit{A}$, $\\textit{B}$, and $\\textit{C}$ we have the following properties\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Commutative Law of Addition: $\\textit{A} + \\textit{B} = \\textit{B} + \\textit{A}$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Associative Law of Addition: $(\\textit{A} + \\textit{B}) + \\textit{C} = \\textit{A} + (\\textit{B} + \\textit{C})$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Associative Law of Multiplication: $\\textit{A}(\\textit{B}\\textit{C}) = (\\textit{A}\\textit{B})\\textit{C}$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Distributive Law: $\\textit{A}(\\textit{B} + \\textit{C}) = \\textit{A}\\textit{B} + \\textit{A}\\textit{C}$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Identity: There is the matrix equivalent of one. We define a matrix $\\textit{I_n}$ of dimension  $n \\times n$ such that the elements of $\\textit{I_n}$ are all zero, except the diagonal elements $i=j$; where $i_{ii} = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Zero: We define a matrix 0 of $m \\times n$ dimension as the matrix where all components $ij$ are 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore,\n",
    "\n",
    "$I_3 = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",

    "\n",
    "Here we can write $\\textit{I}\\textit{B} = \\textit{B}\\textit{I} = \\textit{B}$ or \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textit{I}\\textit{I} = \\textit{I}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrix Transpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The **transpose** of a matrix $\\textit{A}$ is formed by *interchanging* the rows and columns of $\\textit{A}$. That is \n",
    "\n",
    "$a_{ij}^T = a_{ji}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vector Multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors have several ways they can be multiplied. In this program, we normally think of vectors as single-row or single-column matrices. Very frequently, we will see column vectors used with matrices. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we have two vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "${\\bf{x}} = (x_1, x_2, ... , x_k)$ and ${\\bf{y}} = (y_1,y_2,...,y_k)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The inner product is written:\n",
    "\n",
    "$${\\bf{x}} \\cdot {\\bf{y}} = x_{1}y_{1}+x_{2}y_{2}+\\cdots+x_{k}y_{k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore this produces a single *scalar* value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following suit with the vectors-as-matrices trope, we can also write:\n",
    "\n",
    "${\\bf{x}} \\cdot {\\bf{y}} = {\\bf{x}^{T}}{\\bf{y}}$ =\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\begin{bmatrix}x_1 & x_2 & \\cdots & x_k\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_k\\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrix Multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "When two matrices $\\bf{A}$ and $\\bf{B}$ are multiplied together we can write the product $\\bf{C}$ in *closed form* \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\bf{C} = \\bf{A}\\bf{B}$, whose elements $c_{ij}$ are given by addition of each component of the two matrices,  $c_{ij} = \\sum_{k=1}a_{ik}b_{kj}$. When done by hand, this process is performed like a vector dot product, multiplying each element in the left matrix's row $i$ by the right matrix's column $j$ and summing. This product becomes the entry $c_{ij}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
