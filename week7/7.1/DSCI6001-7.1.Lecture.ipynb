    "Lagrange multipliers are a direct relative of boundary constraint problems. Both look for the critical points of a surface $f(x,y)$ subject to the constraint g(x,y) = c.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between the two is that lagrange multipliers constrain the two functions to each other using a special coefficient, $\\lambda$ that we allow to change as necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In boundary constraint problems** we:\n",
    "1. Look for critical points within the boundary using the standard method, $\\nabla{f} = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Look for critical points on the boundary by subsituting the boundary equation into the surface equation and looking for critical points with derivative. This should yield an equation in just one coordinate for a 3-d surface. Critical points will be determined in one coordinate only.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Substitute the above critical points in one coordinate into the boundary equation to get the other coordinate, so that we have point pairs on the boundary $(x_i,y_i)$.\n",

    "## Methods of Lagrange Multipliers\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple cases, we might prefer the following method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take the gradient of f and g and set them equal to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Attempt to solve the simultaneous equations to find answers that fit. \n",
    "\n",
    "In virtually every case in this method we don't care at all about the value of $\\lambda$, so we don't solve for it. Thus, substituting out $\\lambda$ makes a neat way to set up equations for solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In less simple cases we might prefer this method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Form the equation $\\Lambda(x_i, \\lambda) = f-\\lambda\\ g$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Take the full gradient of $\\Lambda$, also including $\\lambda$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Solve $\\nabla\\Lambda = 0$, typically by finding $\\lambda$ first.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method yields exactly the same results as above, although sometimes it leads to a little bit better bookkeeping. Both are perfectly fine and correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will prefer the latter method in this set of notes."
