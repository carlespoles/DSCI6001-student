    "###Assigned Reading: Feldman Handout S. 8-10\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that lines and planes describe structures that are spanning, or infinite, in size with respect to their containing coordinate space or field (think of $R^3$).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##Equations of lines\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be discussing parametric equations several times during this term. Parametric equations describe the *pathway* of an otherwise normal linear equation in terms of a single variable, or *parameter*. The parameter (often given as $t$) is something like the coefficients belonging to a span, in that it is assumed to encompass the whole variable space to which it belongs (i.e. all of $R$).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of parametric equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Equations of straight lines in $R^{N}$\n",
    "2. Equations of curvilinear lines in $R^{N}$\n",
    "3. Equations of systems\n",
    "4. Equations of structures\n",
    "\n",
    "We will only cover the first three. There are many more. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we use parametric equations? Because the use of parameters simplifies the analysis of the system. It frequently occurs that derivatives are easier to take and understand when related to a single variable (the parameter) rather than many variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first type of equation, that of a straight line, can be understood in terms of the below figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "![parametric-1d](./images/parametric_line_2d.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write the equation of the line as part of a process controlled by the parameter $\\vec{d}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix}x-x_{0}\\\\ y-y_{0}\\end{bmatrix} = t\\begin{bmatrix}d_{x}\\\\d_{y}\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That vector $\\vec{d}$ is the unit vector in the direction of the line. The parameter simply multiplies it by some coefficient that we choose. We can break this expression up into proper vector sums using the unit vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x-x_{0} = td_{x}$$\n",
    "$$y-y_{0} = td_{y}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dfrac{x-x_{0}}{d_{x}} = \\dfrac{y-y_{0}}{d_{y}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "###Normal Equations of Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "Lines and planes are directly related. A second way to characterize a line is to give a point on the line and a normal vector (ostensibly emerging from the point).\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the equation of the normal to the line vector? Well one way of determining it is to compute it from the dot product, thus we define the normal as any vector which is perpendicular to the line:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{v} = \\begin{bmatrix}x-x_{0}\\\\y-y_{0}\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$n_{\\vec{v}} = \\begin{bmatrix}n_{x}\\\\n_{y}\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
