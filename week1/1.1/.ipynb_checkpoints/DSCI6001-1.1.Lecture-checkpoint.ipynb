    "Equality and ordering of vectors are defined by comparing the vectors’ individual components. Formally, let\n",

    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{y}=\\textbf{z}$ when $y_j=z_j$ (j=1,2,...,k)\n",

    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{0}$ is used to denote the null vector $(0, 0, ..., 0)$, where the dimension of the vector is understood from context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, if x is a k-dimensional vector, $\\textbf{x} \\geq 0$ means that each component $x_j$ of the vector $\\textbf{x}$ is nonnegative.\n",
