    "Any algebraic equation that consists of terms that are either a constant or a constant multiple of a single variable, with power $= 1$, is termed a __linear equation__. For example, $y=5x+3$, $ax+by+cz+d=0$ and $2x_1+3x_2-x_3=5$ are all linear equations (assuming $a,b,c,d$ are all constants). A __system of linear equations__, or __linear system__) is a collection of linear equations involving the same set of variables.
