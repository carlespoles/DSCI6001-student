    "The Gram-Schmidt algorithm is not terribly efficient for heavy repeated applications , however, and so **rotation strategies** are what are typically applied. These are either **Householder reflections** or **Givens rotations**. These strategies are typically employed in the \"Francis\" algorithm which is the current state of the art for square matrix decomposition.  "

    "A simple tweak is the usual way that the QR decomposition is presented in practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "$A = QR$\n",
    "\n",
    "now reverse the order of multiplication:\n",
    "\n",
    "$RQ = Q^{-1}AQ$\n",
    "\n",
    "It so happens, due to reasons not covered in this course, that multiple applications of the similarity transformation result in a final product $RQ$ that becomes upper triangular such that the eigenvalues can be read from the diagonal:\n",
    "\n",
    "$A = Q_{k}Q_{k-1}Q_{k-2}...Q_{1}R$\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical way this above formulation is done is by using **rotations**; either **Householder** or **Givens rotations.** We will only cover Householder rotations today due to time constraints required in developing an intuition for Givens rotations. You are encouraged to explore this on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Householder reflections\n",
    "\n",
    "Householder reflections are a way of obtaining $Q$ implicitly without ever calculating the GS basis directly. They are efficient to calculate using common matrix operations and can be improved using modern techniques of broadcasting. They do not require explicit calculations of matrix products and require less in the way of storage and operations than any of the GS algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Householder reflections: Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Householder transformations are generalizations of reflections across the plane. These are matrices of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H_{u} = I - 2uu^{T}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $I$ is the identity matrix, and $u$ is an $N$ dimensional unit vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "H is symmetric: $(H_{u})^{T} = (I - 2uu^{T})^{T} = I^{T}-2(uu^{T})^{T} = I - 2uu^{T} = H_{u}$\n",
    "\n",
    "H is also orthogonal: $H_{u}^{T}H_{u} = (I - 2uu^{T})^{T}(I - 2uu^{T}) = I - 4uu^{T} + 4uu^{T}uu^{T} = I$\n",
    "\n",
    "When you apply $H_{u}$ to a target vector $\\bf{y}$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$H_{u}{\\bf{y}} = {\\bf{y}}-2uu^{T}{\\bf{y}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This corresponds to reflecting ${\\bf{y}}$ about the line through the origin perpendicular to ${\\bf{u}}$ as shown in the below figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "![householder](./imgs/householder.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Making use of the standard basis axes as a reference point we can choose\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ u_{1} = \\dfrac{{\\bf{y}} \\pm \\|{\\bf{y}}\\|e_{1}}{\\|{\\bf{y}} \\pm \\|{\\bf{y}}\\|e_{1}}e_{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This produces a reflection along the $e_{1}$ axis. Then we must construct the Householder matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H_{u_{1}} = I - 2u_{1}u_{1}^{T}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This matrix is applied in a rotation of $A$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ X_{1} = H_{u_{1}}A $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is that we use the householder reflection to project ${\\bf{y}}$ onto the axis orthogonal to ${\\bf{u}}$. This projection is propagated throughout the matrix (of column vectors), effectively creating a change of coordinates (a sort of translation). This sets elements below the first diagonal to $0$, and provides a coordinate change to the remaining $n-1$ vectors. Then we take the next vector in the matrix and calculate its reflection against the previously corrected vector, setting the below elements to $0$, propagating to the $n-2$ vectors and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The householder algorithm proceeds for a $m \\times n$ matrix as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "set $Q = I_{n}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$for\\ i\\ in\\ num\\ columns:$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ u_{i} = \\dfrac{{\\bf{y}} \\pm \\|{\\bf{y}}\\|e_{i}}{\\|{\\bf{y}} \\pm \\|{\\bf{y}}\\|e_{i}}e_{i}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ H_{i} =  I - 2u_{i}u_{i}^{T}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ Q = QH_{i}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally you end up with a series of $Q = Q_{n-1}Q_{n-2}...Q_{1}$, giving a final estimate for the real $Q$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get the $QR$ decomposition of the two-vector matrix \n",
    "\n",
    "$X = \\begin{bmatrix}1. & 1.26\\\\1. & 1.82\\\\1.& 2.22 \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "We first choose a $u$ to take the first column of the matrix to the x-axis:\n",
    "\n",
    "$u_{1} = \\begin{bmatrix}1.\\\\1.\\\\1.\\end{bmatrix}-\\sqrt{3}\\begin{bmatrix}1.\\\\0\\\\0\\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we need to normalize it:\n",
    "\n",
    "$u_{1} = \\dfrac{u_{1}}{\\|u_{1}\\|} =\\dfrac{1}{1.5925} \\begin{bmatrix}-0.7321.\\\\1.\\\\1.\\end{bmatrix}$\n",

    "\n",
    "And we'll start off the creation of Q by allowing the first $Q_{i}$ to be $H_{u_{1}}$:\n",
